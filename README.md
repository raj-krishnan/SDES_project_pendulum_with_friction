# SDES Project: Pendulum with Friction

The primary forces acting on the pendulum bob are the gravitational force 
that makes it move in the first place and the force exerted by the string
to keep it moving along a circular path. In addition, there may be a 
damping force from friction at the pivot or air resistance or both. We 
will model how the X and Y coordinates of the pendulum vary as a function 
of time t.
